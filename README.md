|[Queue.h](Assignment2/Queue.h)|Header file for assignment 2.|
|[Queue.cpp](Assignment2/Queue.cpp)|Priority Queue implementation for Assignment2.|
|[Assignemnt3.cpp](Assingment3/Assignment3.cpp)|Create Binary tree and perform following operations:<br>a. Insert<br>b. Display<br>c. Depth of a tree<br>d. Display leaf-nodes<br>e. Create a copy of a tree.|
|[Assignemnt4.cpp](Assingment4/Assignment4.cpp)|Construct and expression tree from postfix/prefix expression and perform recursive and non- recursive In-order, pre-order and post-order traversals|
|[Assignemnt5.cpp](Assingment5/Assignment5.cpp)|Implement binary search tree and perform following operations:<br>a. Insert<br>b. Delete<br>c. Search<br>d. Mirror image<br>e. Display<br>f. Display level wise|
|[Assignemnt6.cpp](Assingment6/Assignment6.cpp)|Consider a friends‘ network on face book social web site. Model it as a graph to represent each node as a user and a link to represent the fried relationship between them. Store data such as date of birth, number of comments for each user.<br>1. Find who is having maximum friends<br>2. Find who has post maximum and minimum comments<br>3. Find users having birthday in this month<br>Hint: (Use adjacency list representation and perform DFS and BFS traversals).|
|[users.h](Assingment6/users.h)|Header file for Assignment6.|
|[users.cpp](Assingment6/users.cpp)|Graph Implementation for Assignment6.|
|[Assignemnt7.cpp](Assingment7/Assignment7.cpp)|Represent any real world graph using adjacency list /adjacency matrix find minimum spanning tree using Kruskal‘s algorithm.|
|[Assignemnt8.cpp](Assingment8/Assignment8.cpp)|Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix /adjacency list and find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm (single source all destination).|
|[Assignemnt9.cpp](Assingment9/Assignment9.cpp)|Store data of students with telephone no and name in the structure using hashing function for telephone number and implement chaining with and without replacement.|
|[Assignemnt10.cpp](Assingment10/Assignment10.cpp)|A business house has several offices in different countries; they want to lease phone lines to connect them with each other and the phone company charges different rent to connect different pairs of cities. Business house want to connect all its offices with a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.|
|[Assignemnt11.cpp](Assingment11/Assignment11.cpp)|Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. Write a program to create a sequential file to store and maintain student data. It should allow the user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If student record is found it should display the student details.|
|[Assignemnt12.cpp](Assingment12/Assignment12.cpp)|Implement direct access file using hashing ( chaining without replacement) perform following operations on it<br>a. Create Database<br>b. Display Database<br>c. Add a record<br>d. Search a record<br>e. Modify a record|
